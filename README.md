# Client-Ready Business Website (React)

A clean, responsive, one-page business website built with React.  
This project demonstrates practical front-end skills used in real client work: clear layout structure, reusable components, responsive design, and live deployment.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to build a **production-style business website** that could realistically be delivered to a client.  
The focus was on clarity, trust, and usability rather than visual experimentation.

Key priorities:
- Clear section hierarchy for business content
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop users
- Maintainable, component-based React structure
- Simple deployment workflow suitable for real projects

---

## Features

- Responsive one-page layout (mobile-first)
- Reusable React components
- Clean section spacing and readable typography
- Business-focused structure (hero, services, about, contact)
- Deployed live using Netlify
- Version controlled with GitHub

---

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vite**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Netlify (deployment)**

---

## What I Learned

- Structuring a React project for clarity and maintainability
- Breaking UI into reusable, readable components
- Designing layouts with real business users in mind
- Managing a project from setup to live deployment
- Iterating on spacing, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy

---

## Potential Improvements

If this were extended further, I would:
- Add a contact form with validation
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, contrast checks)
- Add subtle UI interactions (hover states, transitions)
- Extract styles into a reusable design system
- Improve performance and SEO basics

---

## Why This Project Matters

This project reflects how I approach front-end development:
- Practical
- User-focused
- Production-oriented

It represents the type of work I would deliver as a junior front-end developer contributing to real products or client websites.
